      <h3>Instructions</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Start the soup: Heat the olive oil to medium heat. Add the minced
          garlic and cook for 30 seconds to 1 minute until light brown and
          fragrant. Stir in both cans of tomatoes, vegetable broth, garlic
          powder, onion powder, ½ teaspoon of the salt, and basil (if using).
          Bring to a simmer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Simmer the soup: Simmer 15 to 20 minutes until slightly thickened and
          the tomato flavor mellows.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, make the grilled cheese: Spread mayonnaise on the outside
          of each slice of bread, and jam or honey on the inside of one of the
          slices. Place a skillet over medium high heat and add one slice of
          bread, mayo side down. Top with the shredded cheese (and apple, if
          using) and other slice of bread. Cook until the bread is golden brown
          and toasted, then flip and cook a few minutes more until the second
          bread slice is toasted and the cheese is warm. If you’re making
          multiple sandwiches, make the sandwiches as noted, then bake them on
          an oiled or parchment lined baking sheet at 450 degrees Fahrenheit for
          about 5 minutes per side, until golden brown.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finish the soup: Immersion blend the soup or carefully transfer to a
          blender and blend until smooth (this step makes it creamier; you can
          skip this step if you’re ok with the texture as is). Then stir in the
          remaining ¼ teaspoon salt and 2 tablespoons salted butter. For a
          richer soup, you can also stir in a splash of heavy cream.
        </li>
